# Car license-plate detection
The project is about car license plate recognition using Raspberry-Pi and a Pi-camera and fetching the user details from https://parivahan.gov.in/parivahan/ using number plate details.

The image_processing.json file, when loaded in NodeRED interface, deploys a pre-trained image processing model named OpenALPR and the data is stored in a json file.

The python code basically collects the data from the json and loads the data in a Google-spreadsheet (personal sheet).
